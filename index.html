        <h1>THE BUTTERFLY PROJECT by Patricia Kuria.</h1>
        </div>
            <h2>Why a butterfly?.....</h2>
                  <p>Usually, butterflies are  a representation of deep and powerful presentations of life.Many cultures associate butterflies with souls. <br>Around the world, people view butterflies as representing endurance,hope, change and life.</p>
                  <p>Well as for me, more or less the same thing but with an element of freedom.</p>
                  <p>This is where by people are free to express their beliefs, beauty and cultures in different ways without any judgement whatsoever.</p>
                  <p>This in my opinion is represented by the different patterns and colours on their wings.</p>
            <div class="sidebar">
                <h3>Fact:Did you know a butterfly can't fly when it's cold?<h3>

            <h2>About me</h2>
                  <p>My name is Patricia Kuria. I come from a humble abode situated in Ruiru.</p>
                  <p>I am educated and graduated successfully with high school being my highest education.</p>
                  <p>I have an undying passion for photography since the word go.</p>
                  <p>My ambition is to become a successful pharmacist who can provide healthcare services with the help of I.T. I mean after all, the world is going digital isn't it?</p>

            <h3>MAN'S BESTFRIEND; THE DOG.</h3>
                  <p>It is believed that man's most faithful and loyal friend is the dog.</p>
                  <p>As you can guess, my pet is obviously  dog. His name is Coco.</p>
                  <p>He is a golden retriever.</p>
                  <p>His favourite toy is a chew-toy which is in the shape of a bone.</p>
                    <img src="images/cocowithhischewtoy.jpeg" alt="a dog with a chew toy">

                  <p>Coco is actually 5 years old which is a striking 40 years in dog years!</p>
                  <p>The age of a dog actually varies due to the type of breed and its size.</p>
                  <p>During his stay with us Coco has been very strong and healthy since birth due to the frequent visits to the vet.</p>
                  <p>He was vaccinated against diseases such as; Canine distemper and canine parovirus which can be fatal.</p>
                  <p>He feeds regularly on meat,bones and dog food.</p>
                  <p>Just as a human baby requires food and care, so does a dog.</p>
            <h3>MY FAVOURITE THINGS</h3>
                  <p>Usually everyone does things ocassionally but there are others one does more often as they tend to enjoy them more.</p>
                  <p>These activities which tend to be done more often and become one's favourite.</p>
                  <p>My favourite things to do are;</p>
                    <ul>
                  <div class= "column">
                        <li>Photgraphy</li>
                          <img src="images/camera.jpeg" alt="photo of a camera">
                  </div>
                  <div class= "column 2"
                        <li>Baking</li>
                          <img src="images/baking.jpeg" alt="photo of cookies on a platter">
                  </div>
                  <div class= "column 3">
                        <li>Riding bikes etc.</li>
                          <img src="images/bicycle riding.jpeg" alt="photo of people riding bikes">
                  </div>
                    </ul>


          <p>Furthermore i've recently added coding to the list of one of my favourite things to do.</p>
          <p>It was a bit challenging at first but now is really enjoyable especially when one gets the hang of things.</p>
          <p>Moreover during my free time, I like doing community projects such as; going to assist in children homes and also plantng trees to save the environment</p>

      <h3>LIFE THROUGH A LENS</h3>
      </div>
        <p>For most people a camera might just be an ordinary machine or object used for fun and taking photos and videos.</p>
        <p>Technically, they are not wrong, but in my opinon there's more to a camera than just a "machine" or an "ordinary object"</p>
        <p>To me a camera is like a magical portal to another dimension. Through a lens, there's a differnt world which lies out there.</p>
        <p>The peace that the world brings is unimagineable. It's as if your third eye has been opened to view the world differently</p>
        <p>In conclusion, the camera does not only take photos and videos but also lots of memories</p>
        <p>Photos can differ from each other. They include:</p>
        <div class="bow">

            <li>aerial photography</li>

            <li>event photography just to mention but a few</li>
